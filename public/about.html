<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>From a young age, I was fascinated by technology and the magic of code. 
  At just 13 years old, I began exploring the world of programming through Roblox, 
  creating small projects that ignited my passion for software development. 
  That early curiosity led me to pursue a path in computer science, constantly pushing myself to learn and build new things.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have developed a deep appreciation for programming languages, with a particular love for C++. 
  I enjoy understanding how things work at a fundamental level, which is why I gravitate toward low-level languages that give me full control over memory, performance, and system interactions. 
  Writing efficient, optimized code is something I take pride in, and I'm always looking for ways to push the limits of what I can create.</p>

<p>Whether it's developing applications, optimizing algorithms, or diving deep into system architecture, I thrive on problem-solving and continuous learning. 
  My journey in technology is just beginning, and I'm excited to keep expanding my skills, taking on new challenges, and building innovative solutions.</p>
