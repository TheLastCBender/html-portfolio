<p> It's Napoleon, what else is there to be said. People have a lot of complaints about the movie but I put it on this list for the way the creators were able to reacreate so many famous battles and really make us feel like we were right there when it was happening. They really took the words in a history book and managed to paint out very beautiful pictures with it.</p>
